# ERL Networking Example

The goal of this project is to provide a template for cave projection setups that use multiple computers.

##Contents
The project is divided into scenes. Each scene is built to provide a full working example of one cave configuration.
We currently have four configurations planned. As development continues more may be added.


###Three Screen Mono
This configuration is to support three computers (Left, Right and Center), each powering a single non-stereo display. 
It assumes all of the machine/displays are the same size/resolution.

####Progress:
Basic networking is in place. Each machine selects which camera it wants to display. 

###Three Screen Stereo
This configuration is to support three computers(Left, Right and Center), each powering a single stereoscopic display. 

####Progress:
Pending

###Four Screen Mono
This configuration is to support four computers(Left, Center, Right, and Floor), each powering a single non-stereo display.
####Progress:
