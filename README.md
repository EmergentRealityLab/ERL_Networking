# ERL Networking Example

##About
The goal of this project is to provide a template for cave projection setups that use multiple computers.

The project is divided into scenes. Each scene is built to provide a full working example of one cave configuration.
We currently have four configurations planned. As development continues more may be added.


###Three Screen Mono
Basic networking is in place. The server is the center projection. Clients can display either right or left projection.
